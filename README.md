# ReSpeaker Tuning GUI
GUI for ReSpeaker USB 4xMic Array tuning.

This was build around the [USB 4xMic Puck](https://www.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker-USB-Mic-Array-p-4247.html).
It might work with other ReSpeaker devices, but I do not have access to them at present.

Needs Python3 and PySide2 as well as the libraries that the [usb_4_mic_array](https://github.com/panmarco83/usb_4_mic_array.git) requires.

```
git clone https://github.com/panmarco83/ReSpeaker_Tuning_GUI.git
cd ReSpeaker_Tuning_GUI
git submodules init
git submodules update
```
